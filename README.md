### NMDE toolbox 
### NMDE--Numerical Method in Differential Equations

* this is a course projects of NMDE, including the numerical methods on both DE and PDE
* most of the codes in those projects were writen in MatLab/Python/C++
* the book we use for this course is "numerical method on differential equations", the auther is Ronghua Li
* Chinese Version：《微分方程数值解法》,李荣华
